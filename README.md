# DevBox

DevBox helps you develop full stack applications quickly by providing a set of convenience functions to handle:

* Local Docker networking (sync container IP addresses with /etc/hosts)
* Tunnelling using Cloudflare

The goal of DevBox is to add extensions that wrap tedious operations required to develop fast.
